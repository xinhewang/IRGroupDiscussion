### Scenario Design
1. Target users:
People who want to buy product online
2. Key Goals:
Let users to buy more products they really want
3. How can I help them accomplish their goals?
* Cluster models can perform much of the computation
offline, but recommendation quality
is relatively poor. To improve it, it’s possible to
increase the number of segments, but this
makes the online user–segment classification
expensive.
* Search-based models build keyword, category,
and author indexes offline, but fail to provide
recommendations with interesting, targeted
titles. They also scale poorly for customers with
numerous purchases and ratings.
